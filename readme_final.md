# JavaScript Object Manipulation – Sculpture List Lengths

## Objective
This Node.js project loops through a list of sculpture objects and creates a new array of objects where each property value is replaced by the **length** of its string value.

---

## Files Included
- `data.js` – contains the array of sculpture objects.  
- `sculptureScript.js` – processes the data and creates a new list of string lengths.  
- `readme.md` – includes this explanation and the full output of the `sculptureListLengths` object.

---

## How It Works
1. Import the sculpture data from `data.js`.  
2. Loop through each sculpture object.  
3. For each property (such as `name`, `artist`, `description`, `url`, and `alt`), calculate the `.length` of the string.  
4. Store those lengths in a new array called `sculptureListLengths`.  
5. Print the result to the console.  

Run the script using:
```bash
node sculptureScript.js
```

## sculptureListLengths Output

Below is the **actual content** of the `sculptureListLengths` array generated by running the script on the provided dataset.

## Submission Steps
1. Upload these files (`data.js`, `sculptureScript.js`, and `readme.md`) to your GitHub repository.  
2. Run your script and verify that it outputs the same `sculptureListLengths` content shown above.  
3. Include the GitHub link and a screenshot of the console output in your PDF submission to Canvas.
